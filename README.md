Title:
Farm on Hand: Fresh from the Fields to Your Fingertips

Problem Statement:

Traditional agricultural supply chains often involve numerous intermediaries, leading to 
inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and reduced profits for farmers. The absence of a direct 
channel between farmers and end consumers or vendors further exacerbates these issues.

Objective:

1. To Facilitate direct sales of farmers' products to consumers and vendors.
2. To Develop a versatile web platform named Farm on Hand.
3. To Bridge the gap between farmers and buyers, ensuring transparency and efficiency in 
agricultural transactions.
4. To Provide a seamless marketplace connecting farmers with end consumers and 
vendors.
5. To Foster a transparent and efficient agricultural ecosystem through direct sales 
channels.
6. To Enhance profitability for farmers by eliminating intermediaries and improving 
market access.
7. To Ensure fair returns for producers while offering convenience and variety to 
consumers and vendors.
8. To Utilize the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NodeJs) to build a scalable 
and feature-rich platform.

Feasibility Study:

Technical Feasibility:

• The MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NodeJs) offers robust and scalable 
tools for building web applications, suitable for handling the complexity of a 
marketplace platform.
• The chosen technologies provide flexibility for implementing features such as user 
authentication, real-time updates, and secure transactions.
• Availability of resources, documentation, and community support for MERN stack 
development enhances technical feasibility.
Operational Feasibility:
• The platform's user-friendly interface and intuitive design ensure ease of use for 
farmers, consumers, and vendors.
• Integration of features such as product listings, search functionalities, order 
management, and payment processing streamlines operations for all stakeholders.
• Continuous maintenance and updates will be essential to address operational challenges 
and ensure smooth functionality.
Economic Feasibility:
• Direct sales through Farm on Hand eliminate intermediaries, allowing farmers to fetch 
better prices for their produce.
• Reduced transaction costs and improved market access contribute to increased 
profitability for farmers.
• Revenue generation through transaction fees or subscription models ensures 
sustainability and scalability of the platform.
